MediaTomb - UPnP AV Mediaserver for Linux.

v0.7.1  17.04.2005   D-Link DSM-320 fix
        * Mappings of mime-types to upnp classes are now configurable.
          Actually this is how we solved the DSM-320 problem - they
          crashed if upnp class of items was different than what the
          DSM expected.

        * tomb-install now creates the database and configuration file
          from templates (was hardcoded); also sets the name of the server
          individually for each user (host / username)

        * Improved handling of configuration, if non critical options are
          missing we are now setting default values.

v0.7    14.04.2005   First release
        * The changelog does not start at day 0, updates will be made
          starting from this release.
