Known Issues (ordered by importance)

- When directories are added recursively all subdirectories traversed
  are always created in the PC Directory, regardless if any files from
  those directories are taken to the database. This produces A LOT of
  garbage in the PC Directory and must be fixed ASAP.

- Deleting an arbitrary item does not trigger any consistency check.
  Virtual items do not relate to their referenced items. This must be
  changed. The item in a PC Directory would be the 'master copy'
  and once deleted all referring virtual items should be deleted as well.

- Make all metadata produced by javascript be stored in the database.
  Instead of iterating through all known metadata keys, should iterate
  through all meta properties of the object given to addObject().
  (still don't know how to iterate over properties with spidermonkey)

- Session ID's do not timeout and/or are destroyed.

Planned improvements / features (ordered by importance)

- introduce means to cascade scripts. Probably something like include()
  function or preprocessor directive.

- on the fly reloading of scripts and immediate automatic recreation
  of virtual structure. Should be simple - delete all virtual objects and
  pass every item inside the PC Directory to the script again. This will
  lighten js development a lot.

- Virtual and corresponding items should share common metadata. Normally
  almost all metadata will be equal. Currently all data is copied for every
  created virtual item. Metadata handling functionality should be reviewed
  once more.
  
- include mysql support (already working) into the main branch
  and write autoconf/automake stuff for conditional compilation of
  sqlite3 and/or mysql storage. (That's a challenge :)
